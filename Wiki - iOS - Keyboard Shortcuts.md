Always add shortcuts with the whole phrase in lowercase as iOS will convert it to your current keyboard capitalization mode. That way you can use it in the middle or beginning of a sentence. Or in all caps, if you’re pissed.

* (your initials or something) -> (your email address)
* myapt -> (your full home address)
* “fuck” (no alias, this will keep it from autocorrecting to “duck”)
* "lmk" -> "let me know"
* "ott" -> "just got off the train"
* "ppl" -> "people"
* "rr" -> "are"
* "tho" -> "though"
* "yy" -> "you"
* "uu" -> "why"
