# Common Mistakes

FYI: Those are completely taken from [Writer's Block](http://web.archive.org/web/20130117225252/http://writersblock.ca/tips/monthtip/tipmar98.htm).

## Two-Letter Words

Some writers lowercase all two-letter words, probably by extrapolation from the short prepositions "of", "to", "up", and so on, and the word "to" in infinitives. But if a two-letter word is acting as a noun, pronoun, adjective, or adverb, it must be capitalized. For example:

> Go Tell it on the Mountain

Wrong; "it" is a pronoun and should be capitalized.

> When is a Spade a Spade?

Wrong; "is" is a verb and should be capitalized.

## Multipurpose Words

Some writers lowercase words that can function as prepositions when those words are currently functioning in other capacities. For example:

> The Man in the Moon Owns a Yellow Balloon

Correct; "in" is functioning as a preposition and should be lowercased.

> Bringing in the Sheaves

Wrong; "in" is functioning as an adverb and should be capitalized.

## Phrasal Verbs

Some writers find it hard to decide how to capitalize a title containing a phrasal verb. Phrasal verbs are verbs whose meaning is completed by a word called a particle. For example, the verb "to give" has a different meaning than the phrasal verb "to give up".

Like other multipurpose words, words functioning as particles must be distinguished from the same words functioning as prepositions. Particles are always capitalized because they form part of the verb. For example:

> My Travels up Nova Scotia's South Shore

Correct; "up" is functioning as a preposition and should be lowercased.

> Setting up Your Computer

Wrong; "up" is functioning as a particle and should be capitalized.

## Mistaken Notions

Grammar just doesn't sink naturally into everyone's head. To some writers, the fact that one word resembles another is enough reason to treat those words equally when it comes to capitalization in a title. For example:

>The Time of their Lives

Wrong; "their" is an adjective and should be capitalized—the writer probably extrapolated from "the".
